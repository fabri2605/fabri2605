# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Fabricio Di Paolo

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various projects for the transport ministry of my city. Mostly working with Docker & Laravel but there are problems in other areas that i have to cover all the time. At the start i felt nervous but now my confidence has began to raise.

#### ðŸŒ± In the past 3 years I has been studing React and React Native. Some of the pages I have developed are in my briefcase (https://my-briefcase-three.vercel.app/). Also I worked very hard on a JAVA course that also teached me the basics of the backend and fundamentals of Git, MySQL, & CSS.

#### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for a job in wich I could discuss with other developers and learn together because actually I am the only programmer at my work place.
